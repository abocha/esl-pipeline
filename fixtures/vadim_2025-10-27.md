**Four Opinions: How I Change the Way I Feel**

**1. Leila: I smell books to focus.**
When I want to focus on work, I smell old books. It sounds strange, but the smell makes me feel calm. If I smell paper, my brain knows it's time to study. I also turn off all screens. If I see my phone, I start thinking about other things.

**2. Martin: I use light to change my mood.**
Light is very important to me. If the room is too dark, I feel tired and lazy. So I use bright white lights when I have to code for a long time. If the light looks like daylight, I stay more awake and focused. It feels like morning all day.

**3. Clara: I listen to music I don't know.**
If I listen to my favorite songs, I just sing and stop working. So I play music in languages I don't understand. If I don't know the words, I feel more focused. It sounds nice, but it doesn't take my attention.

**4. Pablo: I dress for the task.**
If I stay in my pajamas, I feel slow. So I put on shoes and a nice shirt, even at home. It looks silly, but it makes my brain think I'm doing something important. If I dress up, I do more. Sometimes I even wear a watch to feel professional.

## 4. üõ†Ô∏è Language Toolkit: Useful Language
### A. üëÄ Notice the Grammar: Linking Verbs + Adjectives
We use special verbs like `be`, `feel`, `sound`, `look`, `smell`, and `seem` to describe a state or quality, not an action. After these "linking verbs," we use an **adjective**, not an adverb.

*   **Form:** `Subject + Linking Verb + Adjective`
    *   *Example from text:* "It **sounds strange**." (NOT `strangely`)
    *   *Example from text:* "I **feel tired**." (NOT `tiredly`)
    *   *Example from text:* "It **looks silly**." (NOT `sillily`)

*   **Meaning:** These verbs link the subject to a description. They act like an equals sign (=).
    *   It = strange.
    *   I = tired.
    *   It = silly.

*   **Use:** We use this structure to describe how something is, seems, or appears to our senses.

*   **Contrast with Action Verbs:** Action verbs describe what someone *does*. After an action verb, we use an **adverb**.
    *   *Linking Verb + Adjective:* The music **sounds nice**. (describes the music)
    *   *Action Verb + Adverb:* He plays the guitar **nicely**. (describes how he plays)

### B. üó£Ô∏è Useful Chunks & Vocabulary
*   **to focus on (something)**: to give all your attention to something. (e.g., "I want to focus on work.")
*   **mood** (n.): the way you are feeling at a particular time. (e.g., "I use light to change my mood.")
*   **calm** (adj.): peaceful, quiet, and without worry. (e.g., "The smell makes me feel calm.")
*   **focused** (adj.): able to give all your attention to something. (e.g., "I feel more focused.")
*   **silly** (adj.): not serious; a little foolish or funny. (e.g., "It looks silly, but it works.")
*   **professional** (adj.): relating to a job that needs special skill or education. (e.g., "I wear a watch to feel professional.")
*   **to dress up**: to put on nice clothes. (e.g., "If I dress up, I do more.")

## 5. ‚úçÔ∏è Practice & Pronunciation
### A. üî© Controlled Practice
*Choose the correct word to complete each sentence.*

1.  That new UI design looks really _______. (good / well)
2.  It's not _______ big problem for me; I can fix it. (a / the / no article)
3.  He explained the bug very _______. (clear / clearly)
4.  I need to go to _______ bed soon; I'm tired. (a / the / no article)

9.  When I work from home, I often feel too _______. (relaxed / relaxedly)
10. Can you listen to _______ podcast and tell me what you think? (a / an / no article)

### B. ü§î Comprehension Check
*Answer these questions based on the study text.*

1.  What does Leila do when she sees her phone?
2.  Why does Martin use bright white lights?
3.  According to Pablo, what happens if he stays in his pajamas?

### C. üéôÔ∏è Pronunciation Micro-Focus (‚âà1 min)
*   **Target:** The `-ed` ending in "focused". Remember, because the sound before `-ed` is /s/, we pronounce the ending as a /t/ sound: /Ààfo ä.k…ôst/.
*   **Action:** Listen to this line from the text: "I stay more awake and **focused**." Shadow the line 3-4 times, paying attention to the /t/ sound at the end of "focused".
*   **Deliverable:** Send a short voice note of you saying the target sentence twice.

## 6. ‚úÖ Your Turn: Complete the Mission!
*   **Task:** It's time to complete your mission! Think about your own life. **What is one strategy you use to change how you feel?** (For example, to feel more focused, more relaxed, or more energetic).

    In a voice message (60-90 seconds), describe what you do and how it makes you feel. Try to use at least **two linking verbs** (`feel`, `sound`, `look`, etc.) with adjectives and use `a/an` correctly.

*   **Plus Task (Optional):** Write your answer from the main task in a short paragraph (4-5 sentences). Then, add a second paragraph describing a strategy that *doesn't* work for you and explain why.

## 7. üß† Why This Mission Helps You
This mission directly targets two of your main goals: using adjectives correctly after verbs like `feel` and `sound`, and remembering to use `a/an` with singular nouns. Building automaticity with these fundamental patterns is the most important step for you right now to make your English sound more natural and fluent.

*(This is just one example. Your answer will be different!)*

"To feel more focused when I study, I have a special playlist of instrumental music. It's just piano and some soft electronic sounds. It helps because my room **feels quiet** and peaceful. If I listen to music with words, I get distracted. This music **sounds calm**, and it helps me think more clearly. It's **a simple strategy**, but it's very effective for me."

## 9. üë®‚Äçüè´ Teacher's Follow-up Plan
:::toggle-heading Teacher‚Äôs Follow-up Plan
*   **Warm-up Idea:** Start the next lesson by asking the student to share his mission response. Ask follow-up questions: "How did you discover this strategy? Does it always work? What do your friends do to focus?"
*   **Error Correction Focus:** During the warm-up and lesson, listen specifically for:
    1.  **Omission of `a/an`** before singular countable nouns (e.g., "I listen to podcast" instead of "...a podcast").
    2.  **Adjective/Adverb confusion** after linking verbs (e.g., "It sounds calmly" instead of "...calm"). These two patterns are the highest priority for correction and reinforcement.
