## 1. 🎯 This Week's Mission Briefing
:::callout 💡
**Your Goal This Week:** By the end of this assignment, you will be able to switch correctly between talking about what you **can** do (ability) and what you **want** to do (desire) without mixing the grammar rules.
:::

:::column-list
    :::column
    ### Pattern A: Ability
    **`Can` + Verb**
    *No `to`, No `-s`*
    - I can go
    - She can go
    :::
    :::column
    ### Pattern B: Desire
    **`Want` / `Need` + `to` + Verb**
    *Yes `to`, Yes `-s`*
    - I want to go
    - She wants to go

## 6. ✅ Your Turn: Complete the Mission!
:::callout 🎙️
**Task:** Talk about your cat, **Barsik**. Record a 1-minute audio.
:::

## 7. 🧠 Why This Mission Helps You
In the last lesson, we saw that mixing these rules is easy to do when speaking fast (e.g., *"She can speaks"*). This mission slows you down and forces you to apply the strict rules to a familiar topic (your cat), helping your brain separate the two grammar patterns permanently.

## 8. 🔑 Answer Key & Sample Mission
:::toggle-heading Answer Key
### A. Controlled Practice Answers
1.  She **can speak** English very well. (No -s after can)
2.  I **want to** go to the cinema. (Need 'to' after want)
3.  He **can drive** a car. (No 'to' after can)
4.  My wife **doesn't want** to cook today. (No -s in negative)
5.  **Can you swim?** (No 'to' after can)
6.  He **needs to** finish his work. (He + needs)
7.  She **can run** very fast. (No -s on can)
8.  I **cannot / can't** dance. (Don't use 'don't' with can)

### B. Comprehension Check Answers
1.  No, she doesn't. She can't hit the ball.
2.  He doesn't want to use it anymore. (He can give it to Emma's brother).
3.  He needs to buy some new shoes.

### C. Sample Mission Response
"My cat Barsik is very funny. He wants to sleep all day. He wants to eat fish every morning. He can jump very high, and he can run fast when he sees a bird. But he cannot speak English, and he cannot cook his own dinner!"

## 9. 👨‍🏫 Teacher's Follow-up Plan
:::toggle-heading Teacher’s Follow-up Plan
* **Warm-up Idea:** "Rapid Fire Switch." Teacher gives a verb (e.g., "drive"). Student must instantly make two sentences: one with CAN, one with WANT.
    *   Teacher: "Drive." -> Student: "I can drive. I want to drive."
    *   Teacher: "She / Cook." -> Student: "She can cook. She wants to cook."
* **Error Correction Focus:** Strict monitoring of "She can speaks" and "He can to..." errors. If these persist, we will do a drilling exercise next lesson.
