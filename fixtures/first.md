## 1. üéØ This Week's Mission Briefing
*   **Your Goal This Week:** By the end of this assignment, you will be able to confidently describe a personal "hack" or routine you use to change your mood or focus.
*   **Key Language You Will Use:** Linking Verbs + Adjectives (`it feels calm`, `it sounds strange`) and Zero Conditionals (`If I..., I...`).

## 2. üó∫Ô∏è Your Homework Roadmap
*   **Time Plan:** Choose a load that fits your schedule this week. The **Default** plan is recommended.
  *   **Light (‚âà15 min):** Step 3 (Input) ‚Üí Step 6 (Mission) ‚Üí Step 5A (Controlled Practice).
  *   **Default (‚âà25 min):** Complete all steps in order from 3 to 6.
  *   **Plus (‚âà40 min):** Complete all steps, plus the optional writing task in Step 6.
*   **The Steps:**
  1. Engage with the **Input Material**.
  2. Study the **Language Toolkit**.
  3. Complete the **Practice & Pronunciation** tasks.
  4. **Complete Your Mission!**

## 3. üéß Input Material: The Source
This homework is based on the text we studied in our lesson about how different people change the way they feel to improve their focus.

### B. ü§ñ Generated Material
*   **Study Text: Four Opinions on How to Change Your Mood**
:::study-text Transcript
Leila: I smell books to focus. When I want to focus on work, I smell old books. It sounds strange, but the smell makes me feel calm. If I smell paper, my brain knows it's time to study.

Martin: I use light to change my mood. If a room is too dark, I feel tired and lazy. So I use bright white lights when I have to code. If the light looks like daylight, I stay more awake and focused. It feels like morning all day.

Chloe: I listen to music that I don't know. If I listen to my favorite songs, I just sing and stop working. So I play music in languages I don't understand. If I don't know the words, I feel more focused. It sounds nice, but it doesn't take my attention.

Pablo: I dress for the task. If I stay in my pajamas, I feel slow. So I put on shoes and a nice shirt, even at home. It looks silly, but it makes my brain think I'm doing something important. I even wear a watch to feel professional.

## 4. üõ†Ô∏è Language Toolkit: Useful Language
### A. üëÄ Notice the Grammar: Linking Verbs + Adjectives
We use linking verbs (`be`, `feel`, `look`, `sound`, `seem`) to describe the subject, not to show an action. Because they describe, they are followed by an **adjective**.

*   **Form:** `Subject` + `Linking Verb` + `Adjective`
    *   *It sounds **strange**.*
    *   *I feel **tired** and **lazy**.*
    *   *It looks **silly**.*

*   **Meaning:** These verbs connect the subject to a description or a state of being.
    *   `He feels tired` = His condition is "tired."

*   **Use:** We use this pattern to describe states, feelings, and appearances.

*   **Contrast with Action Verbs:** Action verbs are followed by an **adverb** (`-ly`) because they describe *how* an action is done.
    *   Linking Verb: `His plan sounds **interesting**.` (describes the plan)
    *   Action Verb: `He explained his plan **interestingly**.` (describes how he explained)

### B. üó£Ô∏è Useful Chunks & Vocabulary
*   **to change my mood** üé≠: to alter how you feel emotionally.
*   **to focus on work** üíª: to concentrate on your professional tasks.
*   **to feel calm/tired/slow** üòå/üò¥/üê¢: to experience a feeling of peace/exhaustion/low energy.
*   **to stay awake** üëÄ: to not fall asleep.
*   **to take my attention**  distraction.
*   **to feel professional** üëî: to feel serious and ready for work.
*   **a "hack"** üí°: a clever trick or solution to a problem.

2.  Why does Pablo wear a watch at home?

### C. üéôÔ∏è Pronunciation Micro-Focus (‚âà1 min)
*   **Target:** Sentence Stress. Notice how the key information words are stressed to carry the meaning.
    *   "It sounds **STRANGE**, but the smell makes me feel **CALM**."
*   **Action:** Listen to the audio of the study text (or read it aloud yourself) and try to copy the rhythm of that sentence 3-4 times.
*   **Deliverable:** You don't need to record anything for this, just practice the rhythm.

## 6. ‚úÖ Your Turn: Complete the Mission!
*   **Task:** It's time to complete your mission! Think about **one** small "hack" you use to change how you feel. For example, to feel more focused, more relaxed, or more creative.
    *   Record a **1-minute voice note** describing your routine.
    *   **Try to use:**
        *   At least one linking verb + adjective (e.g., *I feel...*, *It sounds...*).
        *   At least one zero conditional sentence (*If I..., I...* or *When I..., I...*).
        *   The phrase "**a routine**" or "**a hack**" to practice your articles.

*   **Plus Task (Optional):** Write a short paragraph (3-4 sentences) describing a different "hack" that a friend or family member uses. For example, "My sister has **an interesting** routine. When she feels stressed, she..."

## 7. üß† Why This Mission Helps You
This mission is designed to move your knowledge of fundamental grammar from your head into your mouth. By describing a real, personal routine, you are creating strong connections in your brain. This helps make the `linking verb + adjective` pattern and the correct use of `a/an` more automatic, which is our core goal.

"Okay, so I have **a simple hack** for when I need to solve **a difficult** programming problem. If I feel stuck, I stop coding and clean my work desk. It sounds a bit silly, but it works for me. When my desk looks clean and organized, I feel more calm and my brain feels clearer. After about ten minutes, I'm ready to look at the problem again with a fresh perspective."

## 9. üë®‚Äçüè´ Teacher's Follow-up Plan
:::toggle-heading Teacher‚Äôs Follow-up Plan
*   **Warm-up Idea:** Start the next lesson by asking the student to tell you about the personal "hack" he described in his voice note. Ask follow-up questions that elicit more linking verbs: "That's interesting! How does that make you *feel*? Does it *look* strange to other people?"
*   **Error Correction Focus:** During the warm-up and throughout the lesson, listen specifically for two things:
    1.  **Automaticity of Articles:** Did he say "I have *a* hack" or "It's *a* good routine"? Gently correct any omissions of `a/an` with singular countable nouns.
    2.  **Adjective vs. Adverb:** Listen for correct adjective usage after `feel`, `look`, `sound`, etc. ("I feel *calm*," not "*calmly*").
