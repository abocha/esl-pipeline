### B. ü§ñ Generated Material
*   **Study Text:**
:::study-text
Last month, I finished the biggest project of my career so far. At the beginning, it **was supposed to** be a simple market analysis report. We were given two weeks, and everything seemed clear.

However, after a week, we hit a major obstacle. **The key issue** was that our main data source was suddenly unavailable. This **posed a real problem** for the whole team, as our deadline was approaching quickly. I remember feeling **a surge of anger** and frustration. I was so worried we would fail. My manager, seeing my stress, came over and **whispered softly**, "Don't worry, we'll find a solution together."

In the end, we managed to find an alternative data set and worked overtime to finish. When we finally presented the report, I was **fully aware** of how much we had overcome. The clients were very happy with the result. Walking out of that meeting, I felt an incredible **sense of pride** in what my team and I had accomplished.

## 4. üõ†Ô∏è Language Toolkit: Useful Language
### A. üëÄ Notice the Grammar
*   **Form:** `Subject + be (am/is/are/was/were) + supposed to + verb`
*   **Meaning:** This structure talks about what is expected, planned, or required.
*   **Use:** We often use it in the past (`was/were supposed to`) to show a contrast between a plan and what actually happened. It's perfect for telling stories where things didn't go as expected.
    *   *From the text:* "It **was supposed to** be a simple market analysis report." (The plan was simple, but the reality was complex).
*   **Contrast with:**
    *   `I had to do it.` (Strong obligation, I did it.)
    *   `I was supposed to do it.` (It was my obligation/the plan, but maybe I didn't do it.)

### B. üó£Ô∏è Useful Chunks & Vocabulary
*   **be supposed to** - –±—ã—Ç—å –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω—ã–º (–ø–æ –ø–ª–∞–Ω—É, –ø–æ –æ–∂–∏–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è–º)
*   **the key issue** - –∫–ª—é—á–µ–≤–∞—è –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º–∞
*   **to pose a problem** - —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–≤–∞—Ç—å –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º—É
*   **a surge of anger** - –≤—Å–ø–ª–µ—Å–∫ –≥–Ω–µ–≤–∞
*   **to whisper softly** ü§´ - —à–µ–ø—Ç–∞—Ç—å —Ç–∏—Ö–æ–Ω—å–∫–æ
*   **fully aware** ü§î - –ø–æ–ª–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é –æ—Å–æ–∑–Ω–∞—é—â–∏–π
*   **a sense of pride** üòä - —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ –≥–æ—Ä–¥–æ—Å—Ç–∏

## 5. ‚úçÔ∏è Practice & Pronunciation
### A. üî© Controlled Practice
*Complete the sentences with a word or phrase from the Language Toolkit. You may need to change the form of the verb.*

1.  The fact that we had no budget ___ a major ___ for the event planners.
2.  I ___ meet my friend for coffee yesterday, but she cancelled at the last minute.
3.  When he won the competition, his parents felt a huge ___.
4.  She was ___ of the consequences before she made the decision.
5.  When the computer crashed and deleted his work, he felt a sudden ___.
6.  He leaned in and ___ the secret password ___ so no one else could hear.
7.  For me, ___ was that I didn't understand the instructions clearly.
8.  **[Review]** According to the schedule, the presentation ___ start at 10 AM.
9.  **[Review]** He decided to go to university instead of starting a business. I think it was a ___ choice.

### B. ü§î Comprehension Check
*Answer these questions based on the study text.*

1.  What was the project supposed to be like at the beginning?
2.  What was the main problem ("the key issue") that the team faced?
3.  How did the speaker feel when she finally finished the project?

### C. üéôÔ∏è Pronunciation Micro-Focus (‚âà1 min)
*   **Target:** Sentence Stress in `was supposed to`. Notice how the main meaning is carried by the stressed syllables.
    *   "It **was** su**ppo**sed to be a **sim**ple re**port**."
*   **Action:** Listen to the audio of that line (or say it yourself) and try to copy the rhythm and stress. This is called **Shadowing**.
*   **Deliverable:** Record yourself saying the target sentence 2-3 times. You can include this at the end of your main speaking task recording.

## 6. ‚úÖ Your Turn: Complete the Mission!
*   **Task:** Think about a time you completed a challenging project or task. It could be from work, university, or even a personal project (like organizing a trip).
    **Record a 2-3 minute audio message** for a friend telling the story.
    *   Start by explaining what the plan **was supposed to be**.
    *   Describe the main problem (**the key issue**).
    *   Explain how you felt (**a surge of anger? a sense of pride?**).
    *   Try to use **at least 3** of the new collocations from the Language Toolkit.
    *   **Technique:** Use the **Reflective Recording** method. Record your story once. Listen back to it, notice where you can improve. Then, record a second, better version to send.

*   **Plus Task (Optional):** After recording, write a short paragraph (3-4 sentences) answering this question: "What is one thing you would do differently if you had to do that project again?"

## 7. üß† Why This Mission Helps You
This mission directly targets your main goal: activating your passive knowledge for fluent speech. By taking these new collocations and immediately using them to tell your own story, you are building the mental pathways needed to use them automatically in real conversation. This reduces the need to "build sentences word-by-word" and helps you sound more natural.

### C. Sample Mission Response
"Hey! So you asked about that university presentation I was worried about. Well, it **was supposed to** be a simple 10-minute talk, but the professor changed the requirements last minute. **The key issue** was that we suddenly had to include video clips, and none of us knew how to edit video! I remember feeling **a surge of anger** because it felt so unfair. We almost gave up. But we stayed up all night learning, and somehow we did it. When we got a top grade, I felt such **a sense of pride**. I'm **fully aware** that it was a crazy amount of work, but I'm glad we did it."

## 9. üë®‚Äçüè´ Teacher's Follow-up Plan
:::toggle-heading Teacher‚Äôs Follow-up Plan
*   **Warm-up Idea:** Start the next lesson by asking Anna to summarize her speaking task story in 3-4 sentences. "So, tell me about the project you described. What was it supposed to be, and what was the key issue you faced?"
*   **Error Correction Focus:** Listen for the correct and natural use of the new collocations from Unit 4. Specifically, check if she uses `be supposed to` correctly to contrast a plan with reality. Correct any misuse of prepositions or verb forms within the collocations (e.g., "it posed ~~to be~~ a problem").
