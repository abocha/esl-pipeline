## 1. 🎯 This Week's Mission Briefing
:::callout 🎯
**Your Goal This Week:** By the end of this assignment, you will be able to describe a pet (or a person!) by clearly distinguishing between what they **can do** and what they **want to do**.
**Key Language You Will Use:** `Want to` vs. `Can` (Stopping the "Mixing" Error).
:::

## 2. 🗺️ Your Homework Roadmap

## 3. 🎧 Input Material: The Story of Zaika
* **Context:** In the lesson, the teacher told a story about his smart poodle, Zaika.
* **Reuse Policy:** We will use this text to practice the grammar rules you learned.

### A. 🤖 Generated Material
* **Study Text:**
:::study-text Transcript
**Teacher:** I want to tell you about my dog, Zaika. She is a poodle. She is very smart and loyal.

Zaika **wants to run** away. She says, "I **want to be** independent!" She **can run** very fast. She **can do** many tricks. However, she **cannot run** away because she is on a leash. She **doesn't want to be** on a leash.

But Zaika has a secret. She is actually not independent. If she runs away, she feels lonely. She **wants to be** with her family. She **wants to go** to the toilet with you. She **wants to sit** in the room with you. If you go downstairs to get a Grab delivery, she **wants to go** too. If she **cannot go**, she cries.

## 4. 🛠️ Language Toolkit: Useful Language
### A. 👀 Notice the Grammar (The "Forbidden Mix")
*Tolik, this is the most important part of the homework! Keep these two columns separate.*

:::column-list
    :::column
    **🟢 RULE 1: WANT (+ to)**
    *We use "to" connecting two verbs here.*
    
    *   ✅ He **wants to** go.
    *   ✅ She **wants to** sleep.
    *   ✅ Barsik **wants to** eat.
    *   ❌ *He wants go.* (Missing 'to')
    :::
    :::column
    **🔴 RULE 2: CAN (NO to)**
    *Never use "to" after Can/Can't.*
    
    *   ✅ He **can** go.
    *   ✅ She **can** sleep.
    *   ✅ Barsik **can** jump.
    *   ❌ *He can to go.* (The Forbidden Mix!)
    *   ❌ *She cans go.* (No 's' on Can)

## 5. ✍️ Practice & Pronunciation
### A. 🔩 Controlled Practice (Find the Mistake)
*Tolik, look at these sentences carefully. Some are **Correct**, some are **Incorrect**. Mark them!*

1. Anna wants to cook pancakes. [Correct / Incorrect]
2. Mark can to cook soup. [Correct / Incorrect]
3. Barsik can jumps very high. [Correct / Incorrect]
4. My wife works online. [Correct / Incorrect] **[Review]**
5. He doesn't wants to sleep. [Correct / Incorrect]
6. She can speak English well. [Correct / Incorrect]
7. The Corgi not look at her. [Correct / Incorrect]
8. I need to finish my report. [Correct / Incorrect]

### B. 🤔 Comprehension Check
1. Why does Zaika stay with her family? (Because she is on a leash / Because she is loyal and gets lonely).
2. What does Zaika want to do when the master gets a delivery?
3. Is Zaika an independent dog in reality?

### C. 🎙️ Pronunciation Micro-Focus (≈1 min)
:::callout 🗣️
* **Target:** The "Invisible To" in *Want to*.
* **Note:** Native speakers don't say "Want... To...". They say "Wanna" or "Wan-tə".
* **Action:** Listen to the study text again. Shadow these lines 3 times. Focus on smoothing the connection.
    1. "She **wants to** run away."
    2. "She **wants to** be with her family."
    3. "He **wants to** drink coffee."
* **Deliverable:** Record these 3 sentences and send them to the teacher.
:::

## 6. ✅ Your Turn: Complete the Mission!
* **Task:** Tell me about **Barsik** (your cat) or the **Neighbor's Corgi**.
* **Instructions:** Record a short audio (30-60 seconds) or write 5-6 sentences.
* **You must use:**
    1. One sentence with **Can** (e.g., *He can...*)
    2. One sentence with **Cannot** (e.g., *He cannot...*)
    3. One sentence with **Wants to** (e.g., *He wants to...*)
    4. One sentence with **Present Simple** describing a routine (e.g., *He wakes up...*)

**Example (About a lazy cat):**
*"My cat is lazy. He **wants to** sleep all day. He **can** run fast, but he **doesn't want to** run. He **eats** fish every morning."*

## 7. 🧠 Why This Mission Helps You
You are very logical, but English has two different "logic systems" for these verbs. **System A (Want)** uses "to". **System B (Can)** does not use "to". This homework forces your brain to separate these systems so you don't mix them when speaking to colleagues.

## 9. 👨‍🏫 Teacher's Follow-up Plan
:::toggle-h2 Teacher’s Follow-up Plan
* **Warm-up Idea:** **"Rapid Fire Switch" Game.** Teacher says a verb (e.g., "Drive"). Tolik must instantly create two sentences: "I can drive" and "I want to drive". Then switch to "He" (He can drive / He wants to drive).
* **Error Correction Focus:** Listen strictly for "He can **to**..." or "She can **speaks**...". Stop immediately and gesture for self-correction.
