## 1. 🎯 This Week's Mission Briefing
* **Your Goal This Week:** By the end of this assignment, you will be able to switch correctly between talking about what you **can** do (ability) and what you **want** to do (desire) without mixing the grammar rules.
* **Key Language You Will Use:**
    *   **Pattern A:** `Can` + Verb (No `to`, No `-s`).
    *   **Pattern B:** `Want` / `Need` + **to** + Verb (Yes `to`, Yes `-s`).

## 2. 🗺️ Your Homework Roadmap
* **Time Plan:** The **Default** plan is recommended.
  * **Light (≈15 min):** Step 3 (Input) → Step 6 (Mission) → Step 5A (Controlled Practice).
  * **Default (≈25 min):** Complete all steps in order.
  * **Plus (≈45 min):** Complete all steps, plus an extended writing task in Step 6.
* **The Steps:**
  1. Engage with the **Input Material**.
  2. Study the **Language Toolkit**.
  3. Complete the **Practice & Pronunciation** tasks.
  4. **Complete Your Mission!**

## 3. 🎧 Input Material: The Source
* **Instructions:** Listen to the dialogue. Emma and Dan are talking about hobbies. Notice how they switch between `can` and `want to`.

### B. 🤖 Generated Material
* **Study Text:**
:::study-text Transcript
Emma: I really want to play tennis this weekend. The weather is beautiful.

Dan: That sounds fun. Can you play tennis well?

Emma: No, I can't play very well. I run fast, but I can't hit the ball! I need to practice more.

Dan: I can teach you. I like to play on Saturdays.

Emma: Great! My brother wants to come too, but he can't find his racket.

Dan: He can use my old racket. I don't want to use it anymore.

Emma: Perfect. He needs to buy some new shoes first, but he can buy them today.

## 4. 🛠️ Language Toolkit: Useful Language
### A. 👀 Notice the Grammar: The "Forbidden" Mixes
We practiced this in the lesson. You must keep these two rules separate in your head.

| **Category** | **Verb** | **Rule 1: The "TO" Rule** | **Rule 2: The "-S" Rule** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Modals** | **CAN** | ⛔ **NEVER use "to"**<br>*(Wrong: I can to go)*<br>*(Right: I can go)* | ⛔ **NEVER add "-s"**<br>*(Wrong: She cans go)*<br>*(Right: She can go)* |
| **Normal** | **WANT / NEED** | ✅ **ALWAYS use "to"**<br>*(Wrong: I want go)*<br>*(Right: I want to go)* | ✅ **ADD "-s" (he/she)**<br>*(Wrong: She want to go)*<br>*(Right: She wants to go)* |

### B. 🗣️ Useful Chunks & Vocabulary
*   **That sounds fun.** 🎾 - A common reaction when someone suggests an activity.
*   **hit the ball** ⚾ - To make contact with the ball (tennis, football, etc.).
*   **practice** 🏃 - To do something again and again to get better.
*   **teach** 👨‍🏫 - To help someone learn.
*   **find** 🔍 - To look for something and get it.

## 5. ✍️ Practice & Pronunciation
### A. 🔩 Controlled Practice
*   **Instructions:** Find the mistake in each sentence and write the correct version. **Every sentence has one mistake.**

1.  She can speaks English very well.
2.  I want go to the cinema.
3.  He can to drive a car.
4.  My wife doesn't wants to cook today.
5.  Can you to swim?
6.  He need to finish his work.
7.  She cans run very fast.
8.  I don't can dance.

### B. 🤔 Comprehension Check
*   **Instructions:** Answer based on the text in Step 3.

1.  Does Emma play tennis well?
2.  What does Dan want to do with his old racket?
3.  What does Emma's brother need to buy?

### C. 🎙️ Pronunciation Micro-Focus (≈1 min)
*   **Target:** Smooth transitions. Don't pause between "want" and "to".
*   **Action:** Listen to the model and record yourself saying these quickly:
    *   "I **want to** play." (*wanna play*)
    *   "He **needs to** buy." (*needsta buy*)
    *   "I **can** teach." (*kin teach*)
*   **Deliverable:** Send a voice note.

## 6. ✅ Your Turn: Complete the Mission!
*   **Task:** Talk about your cat, **Barsik**. (Or your wife's favorite Corgi if you prefer!). Record a 1-minute audio.
*   **Please include:**
    1.  Two things Barsik **wants to** do. (e.g., eat, sleep, play).
    2.  Two things Barsik **can** do. (e.g., jump, run fast).
    3.  One thing he **cannot** do.
    4.  **Constraint:** Be careful with `He wants...` vs `He can...`. Don't mix them!

*   **Plus Task (Optional):** Write a short paragraph (4-5 sentences) about a skill *you* want to learn. Use: `I want to learn...`, `I can...`, `I need to...`.

## 7. 🧠 Why This Mission Helps You
In the last lesson, we saw that mixing these rules is easy to do when speaking fast (e.g., *"She can speaks"*). This mission slows you down and forces you to apply the strict rules to a familiar topic (your cat), helping your brain separate the two grammar patterns permanently.

## 8. 🔑 Answer Key & Sample Mission

## 9. 👨‍🏫 Teacher's Follow-up Plan
:::toggle-heading Teacher’s Follow-up Plan
* **Warm-up Idea:** "Rapid Fire Switch." Teacher gives a verb (e.g., "drive"). Student must instantly make two sentences: one with CAN, one with WANT.
    *   Teacher: "Drive." -> Student: "I can drive. I want to drive."
    *   Teacher: "She / Cook." -> Student: "She can cook. She wants to cook."
* **Error Correction Focus:** Strict monitoring of "She can speaks" and "He can to..." errors. If these persist, we will do a drilling exercise next lesson.
